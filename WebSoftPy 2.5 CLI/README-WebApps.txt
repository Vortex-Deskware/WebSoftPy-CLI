Important Usage Guidelines

Unless you are prepared to modify the generated scripts manually, do not move webapps outside of the webapps/ folder. Doing so will break the application’s ability to locate required resources, particularly title bar assets like SVG icons.

Additionally, do not rename a webapp after logging into a website, as this will invalidate its persistent storage path and cause you to lose saved cookies and session data.

For convenient access, we recommend creating desktop or start menu shortcuts to your webapps. A future update will include built-in shortcut creation to streamline this process.
